🎤 Presentation Talk – Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy
Introduction

Hello everyone.
Today, I’m going to present a game called Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy.
Instead of a classic PowerPoint, I chose to create an interactive website, because this game is all about interaction, frustration, and player experience, and I wanted my presentation to reflect that.

1️⃣ Présentation du jeu

Getting Over It was developed and published by Bennett Foddy, an independent game designer.
The game was released in 2017.
It is an indie game that became very popular because of its difficulty and unique concept, especially on YouTube and streaming platforms.

2️⃣ Type du jeu

This game is a 2D physics-based platformer.
It does not focus on action or graphics, but rather on precise control and physics simulation.
The entire gameplay is based on a single mechanic: moving a hammer using the mouse.

3️⃣ Cible / Tranche d’âge

The game is mainly targeted at teenagers and adults.
Even though there is no violence, the game requires patience, emotional control, and perseverance, which makes it more suitable for mature players.

4️⃣ Modèle économique

Getting Over It uses a simple economic model.
It is a one-time purchase game, with no microtransactions, no DLCs, and no pay-to-win mechanics.

5️⃣ Principe du jeu / Objectif du Gameplay

The objective of the game is very simple:
climb to the top of the mountain without falling.
However, there are no checkpoints.
If the player makes a mistake, they can lose a lot of progress, which creates tension and frustration.
The game is designed to test the player’s skill, patience, and mindset.

6️⃣ Points forts du jeu

One of the main strengths of Getting Over It is its original gameplay.
The physics feel realistic and unforgiving.
Another strong point is the narration: Bennett Foddy comments on the player’s failures, which adds a philosophical and psychological dimension to the experience.
Finally, the game creates strong emotions, which is rare in modern games.

7️⃣ Vos critiques

Despite its originality, the game can be extremely frustrating.
The lack of checkpoints may discourage many players.
Also, the game does not offer accessibility options, such as difficulty modes or alternative controls, which limits its audience.

8️⃣ Vos propositions pour améliorer le jeu

To improve the game, I would propose:

An optional practice mode

Accessibility settings, like sensitivity adjustment or visual aids

A non-invasive checkpoint system for beginners
These changes would make the game more accessible without changing its core philosophy.

9️⃣ Exemples de jeux similaires

Games similar to Getting Over It include Jump King, Pogostuck, and Only Up.
These games follow the same idea of high difficulty, punishment for mistakes, and player perseverance.

Conclusion

To conclude, Getting Over It is a game that proves that simple mechanics can create deep experiences.
By using an interactive website for this presentation, I wanted to show not only the game itself, but also how interaction is central to its design.
Thank you for your attention.
